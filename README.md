# Used tech: React + TypeScript + Vite

Fetches weather forecast data from OpenWeather API and displays it in a semi-formatted manner on a SPA React+TS website. If you want to try it yourself: clone the repo, run npm install and then npm run dev. Remember to provide your own API key in a .env file located in weather-app/ with content:
```
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your api-key>
```
